Java 8 lambda test. Searching words with consecutive letters from the alphabet.

I suddenly had this question prying in my mind: are there any word in the Dutch dictionary (I'm Dutch by the way)
that exist only using consecutive letters from the alphabet? After a long though I could think of one: 'Adel'. The Dutch
word for Royal.
Since I wanted to play with JDK 8 and lambda functions I decided to test my theory.

Clone and simply execute:

    mvn exec:java

To see the result.

Made with help from the dictionary from [OpenTaal](http://www.opentaal.org), ('basis-gekeurd' and 'flexievormen').
